1. have a general storytelling draft
   storytelling
   1. simple comparison between two groups
   2. comparison with time factor (number of pro coding years)
   3. reason to have a crazy peak and remove it
   4. appeal to the students
   5. appeal to the hiring companies
2. find a insane median peak whether or not it's my mistake
3. upload a blog post draft with plot, see if that works

So initially, I thought comparing compensation between CS B.S. degree vs bootcamp graduates would work and the result was against my hypothesis. 

CS degree is more attractive in terms of making money. 

However I realized I cannot have simple comparison because I did not take time into the calcuation

CS degree people would normally take 4 years to get started as a professional programmer. On the other hands, bootcamp graduate tend to get a job within a year, so I completely changed a condition. I gave a factor with 3 years of professional experience for bootcamp graudate. (<3 years, but I will have to do = 3 years)
-> this is ok for student who are interested in going to bootcamp
-> this is wrong for companies are interested in hiring bootcamp graduates


so Here are my steps

1. CS degree vs bootcamp with no time factor
2. CS degree vs bootcamp with 3 years or more
3. CS degree with 2 years of exp vs bootcamp with 5 yeras of exp

-> wrong, I had to update my steps
